useState hook is manage to set the state of the variable that we are using in the react because we can not change the values by just using js 
as react manages all the state change and updates

syntax-
header -- import { useState , useCallback } from 'react'
const [value , setvalue] = useState("default value");
value just ast as a variable
setvalue() is function that we use to set the value of the "value" variable

note- we can not change value wihout using the setfunction in react.
